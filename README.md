# 3D Game Engine
Simple 3D game engine implemented using C++ and OpenGL with first person view mainly for the purpose of practicing OpenGL. Camera movement is controlled with keyboard inputs and angle controlled with mouse inputs. Currently only supports 2D and 3D objects, basic camera movement, and shooting projectiles with mouse click.
